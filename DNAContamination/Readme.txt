The class and functions self-made are in:
-SuffixTree.py
-DNAContamination.py
-TreeContaminationDegree.py
-Test.py
The others file .py are taken from DAA collections library provided in the e-learning platform.
In main.py there is already the set-up for the execution of example reported in the midterm-homework, 
so the call to function test. So, for an execution as that in the example, is only necessary to run main.py.
